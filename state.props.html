/*In your own words, explain the essential differences between props and state in
React.

There are essential differences between props and state in react. Props are
immutable within the component, they are created and passed into a component.
State is mutable and can be changed, but it belongs only to a single component.
Props can be used in a parent component and be passed to its children components,
state cannot. A component's state mutates by user events, props do not change
within the component and are simply used in a component.*/
